## Cloud

- [Public](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-public-cloud) - A public cloud is a pool of virtual resources—developed from hardware owned and managed by a third-party company—that is automatically provisioned and allocated among multiple clients through a self-service interface.

- [Private](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/) - The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public. Also called an internal or corporate cloud, private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of a public cloud - including self-service, scalability, and elasticity - with the additional control and customization available from dedicated resources over a computing infrastructure hosted on-premises.

- [Hybrid](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/) - A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
